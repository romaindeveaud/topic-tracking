ABSTRACT
Search result clustering (SRC) is a post-retrieval process
that hierarchically organizes search results. The hierarchical
structure oﬀers overview for the search results and displays
an “information lay-of-land” that intents to guide the users
throughout a search session. However, SRC hierarchies are
sensitive to query changes, which are common among queries
in the same session. This instability may leave users seemly
random overviews throughout the session. We present a new
tool called InfoLand that integrates external knowledge from
Wikipedia when building SRC hierarchies and increase their
stability. Evaluation on TREC 2010-2011 Session Tracks
shows that InfoLand produces more stable results organiza-
tion than a commercial search engine.

INTRODUCTION

Search result clustering (SRC) [1, 4] is a post-retrieval pro-
cess that hierarchically organizes search results. It is used in
Meta search engines such as Yippy.com (previously known
as Clusty). SRC hierarchies display an information “lay of
land” for search and help users to quickly locate relevant
documents from piles of search results.

Session search has recently attracted more attentions in
Information Retrieval (IR) research. A session usually con-
tains multiple queries. These queries are usually highly re-
lated to a main topic and to each other.
Ideal SRC hier-
archies generated for queries in the same session should be
highly related too. However, the state-of-the-art SRC hi-
erarchies are usually sensitive to query changes and hence

demonstrate unstable hierarchies throughout the session. Fig-
ure 1 shows hierarchies generated by Yippy for queries ‘diet’
and ‘low carb diet’ (TREC 2010 session 123). Although
many sessions only show slightly changes among queries1,
the hierarchies built for these queries’ search results can be
dramatically diﬀerent from each other.

The reason that causes unstable hierarchies lies in the fact
that that many hierarchy construction approaches are data-
driven [1, 4]. A common approach, which is also used in
Yippy, is to ﬁrst group similar documents into clusters and
then label the clusters. We observe that clustering-based ap-

hierarchy stability.

We propose a novel hierarchy construction tool, InfoLand,
which injects world knowledge to an existing hierarchy to
increase its stability. Evaluation over TREC 2010 and 2011
Session tracks shows that InfoLand produces signiﬁcantly
more stable stable SRC hierarchies than Yippy.

2. BUILD STABLE CONCEPT HIERARCHIES

We propose three major steps in building stable concept
hierarchies: concept extraction, mapping to Wiki entries,
and hierarchy construction. First, a single query q and its
search results D are processed and a set of concepts C that
best represents D are extracted by algorithms described in
[5]. Concepts from the hierarchy built by Yippy are also
included in C.
Next, for a concept c ∈ C, InfoLand maps it to its most
relevant Wiki entry e, which is called a reference Wiki entry.
We built a Lemur2 index over the entire Wikipedia collection
in ClueWeb09.3 A concept c is sent as a query to the index
and the top 10 returned Wiki pages are examined. The ti-
tles of these pages are considered as candidate Wiki entries
for c and are denoted as {ei}, i = 1··· 10. Due to ambiguity
in natural language, the top returned results may not be re-
lated to the current search session. We hence disambiguate
Wiki entries by measuring the similarity between the entires
and the topics mentioned in the search queries. The similar-
ity is measured by by mutual information between an entry
candidate ei and all concepts C for query q:

(cid:88)

c∈C

MI(ei, C) =

PMI(ei, c|E) × log(1 + ctf (c)) · idf (c)

(1)

where log(1+ctf (c))·idf (c) measures the importance of con-
cept c in representing the main topic in D. Point-wise Mu-
tual Information (PMI) measures the similarity between ei
and c w.r.t. a corpus E: PMI(ei, c|E) = log df(ei,c;E)×|E|
df(ei;E)×df(c;E) ,
where df(x; E) is the document frequency of term x in corpus
E and |E| is the collection size.

The most relevant Wiki entry to the query is selected as
the reference Wiki entry. We obtain reference Wiki entries
ex and ey for concepts x and y and decide whether x sub-
sumes y based on the following cases:

(a) ex is a Wiki category: From ey’s Wiki page, we extract
the Wiki categories that ey belongs to. We call the list of
Wiki categories for ey super categories and denote them as
Sy. x subsumes y if ex ∈ Sy.

(b) Only ey is a Wiki category: x does not subsumes y.
(c) Neither ex nor ey is a Wiki category: We form super
category sets for both Sy and Sx. For each syi ∈ Sy, we
extract its super categories and form a super-supercategory
set SS y for ey. We then measure the normalized overlap be-
tween SS y and Sx: Scoresub(x, y) = count(s;s∈Sx and s∈SSy )
,
where count(s; s ∈ Sx and s ∈ SS y) denotes the number of
categories that appear in both Sx and SS y. If Scoresub(x, y)
for a potential parent-child pair (x, y) is above 0.6, we con-
sider x subsumes y.

min(|Sx|,|SSy|)

Lastly, based on the subsumption relationship identiﬁed,

we form SRC hierarchies as in [3].

3. EVALUATION

Data from TREC 2010 and 2011 Session tracks is used
in the evaluation. For every query q, we retrieve the top
1000 documents from an index built over the ClueWeb09
CatB as its search results D. All TREC oﬃcial ground truth
documents are also merged into the results set. In total, our
dataset contains 299,000 documents, 124 sessions, and 299
queries (on average 2.41 queries per sessions).
Given a session S with queries q1, q2, ... qn, we measure
the stability of SRC by averaging the hierarchy similarity
It is deﬁned as: Stability(S) =
among query pairs in S.
j=i+1 Simhie(Hi, Hj), where n is the number
n(n−1)
of queries in S, Hi and Hj are hierarchies built for qi and
qj, and Simhie(Hi, Hj) is the hierarchy similarity. Methods
to calculate Simhie include fragment-based similarity (FBS),
node overlap, and parent-child precision [5].

Table 1 compares the stability evaluation for hierarchies
generated by InfoLand and by Yippy over the TREC 2010
and 2011 datasets. InfoLand signiﬁcantly outperforms Yippy
in stability in all metrics for both datasets.

Figure 2 shows the SRC hierarchies build by InfoLand
for TREC 2010 session 123. Comparing to Figure 1, we
observe a local expansion of concepts from the left hierarchy
to the right. It coincides well with the fact that this session
contains a speciﬁcation from ‘diet’ to ‘low carb diet’. Other
parts of the two hierarchies remain almost the same; which
demonstrates high hierarchy stability.

4. CONCLUSIONS

Search results hierarchies built for queries in the same ses-
sion are usually sensitive to query changes. This partly di-
minishes the beneﬁts that search result organization intents
to oﬀer. We present a new tool called infoLand that incor-
porates external knowledge to improve the stability of SRC
hierarchies and enable them to better serve as information
lay-of-land to guide session search. Evaluation over TREC
2010 and 2011 Session tracks demonstrates that InfoLand
produces more stable hierarchies than Yippy.
