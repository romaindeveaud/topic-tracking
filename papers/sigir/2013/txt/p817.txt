ABSTRACT
A signiﬁcant portion of Web search is performed in mobile settings.
We explore the links between users’ queries on mobile devices and
their locations and movement, with a focus on interpreting queries
about addresses. We ﬁnd that users tend to have a primary location,
likely corresponding to home or workplace, and that a user’s loca-
tion relative to this primary location systematically inﬂuences the
patterns of address searches. We apply our ﬁndings to construct a
statistical model that can predict with high accuracy whether a user
will be soon observed at an address that had been recently retrieved
via search. Such an ability to predict that a user will transition to
a location can be harnessed for multiple uses including provision
of directions and trafﬁc information, the rendering of competitive
advertising, and guiding the opportunistic completion of pending
tasks that can be accomplished en route to a target location.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Web search on mobile devices, such as smartphones, is becom-
ing increasingly popular.1 Research has demonstrated that search
on mobile devices differs signiﬁcantly from search in desktop set-
tings. For example, Teevan et al. [7] show that queries on such de-
vices are frequently issued while people are in transit and are often
related to in-world destinations such as businesses. A user’s cur-
rent location inﬂuences search, as information goals may be driven
by surrounding entities and resources. Conversely, search can pro-
vide information about a user’s forthcoming locomotion and en-
gagement with physical surroundings.

Geolocation information captured by GPS receivers within smart-
phones can be used to build predictive models that link online inter-
actions to forthcoming transitions among locations in the physical
world. Related prior work studied the relationship between queries

about concerning health symptoms and about proximal medical fa-
cilities [9] and has demonstrated with mobile data when intentions
expressed in search queries may translate into healthcare utiliza-
tion, with evidence of near-term travel to medical facilities [10].
However, mobile search is still poorly understood. Understanding
the interplay of queries and the physical world promises to help
with improving the quality of mobile search, e.g., by consider-
ing geography, proximity, and predictions about future locations
as critical aspects of the context of searches [2]. As a concrete ex-
ample, consider a user who is querying for MEGAMART. If we can
infer from the user’s recent queries and her recent locations that she
intends to go to the closest Megamart store, we can rank driving di-
rections highest, whereas otherwise the Megamart website might
be more appropriate. A service could also provide trafﬁc updates
and status information about the target location, such as the density
of crowds, lengths of lines, and specials at Megamart. Knowledge
that a user is heading to a location can also be used in competitive
advertising campaigns—aimed at persuading the searcher to shift
destinations to an alternate business. In another scenario, an oppor-
tunistic planning application tied to search could provide guidance
on visiting locations and addressing tasks on a pending to-do list
(e.g., deposit checks at a bank located next to Megamart) on the
way to the location [5].

We present a study of user location and locomotion as captured
in geotagged queries logged from a large set of consenting mobile
users. We make two main contributions. First, we show that people
tend to have a primary or dominant location where they use their
device (perhaps home or workplace), and that the search behavior
of users changes when they are not at the primary location and also
as a function of distance from that location. For example, we found
that address queries become more common as users move further
away from their primary location, suggesting that address queries
are used more in less familiar settings. Address queries (e.g., 1 UN
PLAZA, NYC) are particularly interesting, as they have an obvious
connection to the physical world. Second, we characterize empiri-
cally how address queries are used, and we construct and evaluate
a statistical model capable of predicting if an address query will be
followed by the user being observed (via their geotagged queries)
visiting the searched location. Finally, we discuss, in the context of
prior work, the potential applications enabled by these results.

2. DATA

We collected datasets of location and search activities of users
with consent via logs of a major mobile search provider. The data
was provided via a widely available mobile search and navigation
application installed on the iPhone and Android platforms. Users
agreed to share their geotagged queries with the host service of the
application in accordance with a published privacy statement. The
log includes about a year of data logged from approximately 140K
consenting users and consists of millions of search entries stored on

a secure server. Each entry corresponds to a search interaction with
the mobile application issued by an anonymized user (represented
by a unique numerical identiﬁer), which contains the search query,
time, and GPS coordinates (i.e., when and where the query was
submitted). Location information was recorded only if and when a
search query was issued.

3. PRIMARY LOCATIONS

We found that people have regular patterns of mobility, charac-
terized by a small number of spatial anchors at several primary lo-
cations that are regularly visited—potentially representing such re-
current locations as home, work, gyms, restaurants, clubs, and bars.
Even though users’ lives may revolve around several frequent loca-
tions, we simplify our analysis by considering as a reference point
in our analyses the location where most querying is performed.

We divide the Earth’s surface into discrete cells and deﬁne the
cell from which a user queries most as their primary location. We
map GPS latitude/longitude coordinates to discrete map cells by
rounding the GPS coordinates to three decimal places. Due to the
Earth’s spherical shape, the resulting cells vary in size across the
planet; for reference, cells are 84 meters by 110 meters in New
York City. We consider in our analyses only those users who have
issued at least 100 queries during the course of the logging, such
that reliable primary locations could be computed.

Referring to Fig. 1(a), we observe two classes of users: (1) those
who query only from their primary location, and (2) those who also
query from other locations. The latter group vary by the portion of
queries made from the primary location. The distribution of this
percentage is very broad, with most users spending a large percent-
age of their time at their primary location.

Fig. 1(b) shows the relationship between users’ overall numbers
of queries and the fraction of queries made from the primary loca-
tion. We see that, the higher a user’s absolute number of queries,
the higher typically the fraction of queries from the primary loca-
tion. There may be several reasons. One possibility is that heavy
users may employ their mobile devices as substitutes for desktop
computers at home. Another explanation could be that users have
only limited information needs or cognitive capacity while mobile,
whereas searching at home or at work is less constrained.

Per our deﬁnition, most queries are made from users’ primary
locations. However, it is unclear what happens as users stray ever
further from their respective primary locations. As a thought ex-
periment, if each user visited everywhere on Earth with uniform
probability, we would expect the number of queries made at dis-
tance d from the primary location to increase in d, as the number of
places at distances d grows with d. However, the uniform assump-
tion is unrealistic, and Fig. 2(a) shows that, rather than increasing,

we observe a smooth decay in the number of queries as d increases.
At least two factors may play a role in this diminishment: (1) Users
are more likely to stay in places close to than far away from their
primary location. (2) Even when conditioned and renormalized for
the likelihood of a user being at a given location, the probability
of querying there might be smaller the further away that location
is from the primary location. Unfortunately, as we only observe
locations at query time, we have no ground truth about actual user
motion, so we cannot characterize the inﬂuence of these factors.

4. ADDRESS QUERIES

In the last section, we showed that query volume decreases as
users travel further from their primary locations. We observe in the
data that, in addition to quantity, the qualitative nature of queries
also varies spatially. We classiﬁed the queries into 48 categories of
query intent, using a proprietary classiﬁer, where queries could be
classiﬁed into multiple categories (e.g., WEATHER, HOWTO, MAPS).
For example, we found that the fraction of queries tagged as adult
content is higher at the primary location, while queries for street ad-
dresses, among others, are more likely at other locations. Fig. 2(b)
shows that the probability of a query being an address query rises
steadily as a function of the distance between the location where
the query is issued and the primary location. We consider address
queries particularly interesting as they may reveal an intention to
move in the physical world, in contrast to most other queries, which
often signal an intention to navigate among locations on the Web.
We do not know from the logs whether address queries are input
to access information about entities at locations or as a means of
accessing mapping and routing services.

4.1 Characterization

We now characterize the nature of address queries more fully.
We deﬁne as an address query those queries which receive a high
score for being an address by the query classiﬁer (e.g., 47 MAIN ST,
MUNICH, ND 58352) and that could also be resolved to GPS coor-
dinates by a proprietary mapping API. Each address query provides
us with three locations (cf. Fig. 5(a)): the user’s primary location
(P), the location at query time (Q), and the location of the desti-
nation address (D). Several ways of entering address queries are
conceivable: e.g., users might enter the address manually, or they
might copy–paste it from a Web page, email, etc. Our log data does
not specify details about how users input queries.

Fig. 2(b) shows that queries are more likely to be address queries
as the distance to the primary location increases, up to around 100
km. The increase is intuitive: the further you are from the place
you stay at most, the less likely you are to be familiar with your
surroundings, and the more likely you will need to travel to unfa-
miliar locations from a current location. The address query proba-

bility peaks around 100 km, then drops and remains constant. In-
terestingly, previous work [3, Fig. 2(b)] has found that the distribu-
tion of distances between homes resembles the inverse of Fig. 2(b).
This might indicate that users are more likely to query for addresses
when they are outside of residential neighborhoods.

Next, consider Fig. 3(a), which shows a histogram of DP, the dis-
tance from the primary location to the queried location. The ﬁnd-
ing that small values are most probable implies that users are most
likely to query for locations in the immediate vicinity of their pri-
mary locations. Interestingly, there is a local maximum at around
4 km from the primary location. For distances larger than this we
observe ever fewer address queries. Interpreting these ﬁndings is
complicated by the fact that Fig. 3(a) is based on all address queries,
regardless of where they are made. To further investigate, we group
address queries by their distance QP from the user’s primary loca-
tion. In Fig. 3(b), we repeat the histogram of Fig. 3(a), but now only
for address queries made at a distance of at least d from the user’s
primary location (QP ≥ d), for different values of d. Qualitatively,
these stratiﬁed histograms are similar to the overall histogram of
Fig. 3(a). In particular, destinations very close to the primary lo-
cation are still most likely, regardless of how far away a query is
made from the primary location. However, the 4 km hump shifts
with d: now the local maximum lies at around d + 4 km.

Ignoring the uptick on the far left of Fig. 3(b), the distributions
roughly resemble log normals (downward-sloped parabolas on log
axes), i.e., they are long-tailed, with traveled distances normally
being short but sometimes extremely long. The modes of d + 4 km
might result from 4 km being a conveniently traveled distance, tak-
ing just under an hour by foot or 5 min by car. We may then in-
terpret the curves of Fig. 3 as the overlay of two dominant motifs
on queried locations. We ﬁnd that they are: (1) close to the user’s
primary location (the far-left uptick in the ﬁgures), and (2) that they
are close to the current location (the long-tailed part to the right).

To conclude our characterization of address queries, we seek to
understand how prominent these two motifs are as a function of dis-
tance from the primary location. Fig. 4(a) pertains to motif 1 and
plots the probability that a queried address is essentially the user’s
primary location (which we deﬁne as lying within a 100-m radius
from there), as a function of how far away the user is from the pri-
mary location. This probability is highest when the user queries
from a location proximal to the primary location, reaches a mini-
mum at around 1 km from there, and then increases with distance.
The ﬁnal increase may be expected as the farther away one is from
one’s ‘home turf’ the more likely help would be needed to ﬁnd
one’s way home. Perhaps more surprising is the ﬁnding that users
often query for their primary locations while they are at the loca-
tion. This may be caused by users’ exploring their neighborhood,
rather than looking up a predetermined destination. Motif 2 is ex-

Figure 4: (a) Probability of a destination being very close to the
primary location (deﬁned as DP < 100 m) as a function of the
current distance from the primary location. (b) Probability of
a destination being very close to the current location (deﬁned
as QD < 100 m). Queries made from the primary location are
not considered in the black curves.

plored further in Fig. 4(b). The x-axis is again the distance between
the user’s current and primary locations; the y-axis shows the prob-
ability that the destination lies within 100 m from the current loca-
tion. This probability is highest very close to the primary location
(due to the same queries causing the high values on the far left of
Fig. 4(a)) and roughly constant everywhere else.

4.2 Prediction

We now apply the characterizations from above to construct a
statistical model with the ability to predict whether a user will fol-
low up on an address query by going to the queried destination.
Such a classiﬁer would allow us to infer near-term intentions to uti-
lize a real-world resource rather than access information about it
(cf. Sec. 5). As we can only sense user locations when queries are
issued, we cannot identify each instance in which the user moves to
the destination. We can only note the subset of instances in which
the user moves to the destination and then issues a query from there.

Setup. We consider for predictions address queries that are issued
at least 100 m away from the destination. This ensures that the user
can really move towards the destination, rather than query for it
while already there, as we showed was fairly common in the pre-
vious section. Next, we divide these queries into two groups of
address queries: (1) Queries for which we see another query from
the same user on the same day, issued from within 50 m from the
destination address. A radius, such as the 50 m we chose, is neces-
sary because the exact destination is a single point, with a vanish-
ing probability of observing a query from exactly there. (2) Queries
for which we see no such query from the same user. This distinc-
tion deﬁnes the positive and negative classes for our binary classi-
ﬁcation task. The resulting dataset contains around 60K address
queries and is highly unbalanced, with only 4.2K (7%) positive
examples. We compose features based on insights gleaned in the
characterizations above, and build a binary classiﬁer with multiple
additive regression trees [4] to predict follow-up visitation.

Features. We now describe the features used in the classiﬁer. We
use A to denote the user issuing the query.

(U) User features

• Overall number of queries by A
• Percentage of queries A makes from their primary location
• Latitude/longitude standard deviations over all of A’s queries
• Parameters of a log-normal ﬁt to A’s inter-query times (log-
normals match inter-query times well empirically; these pa-
rameters capture the burstiness of A’s querying behavior)

(Q) Query features (including features of the destination)

819• Search type (regular Web search, image search, maps search,

driving/walking directions, news search, etc.)

• Time of day and day of week
• Distances QD, QP, and DP (cf. Fig. 5(a))
• Is query issued from A’s primary location?
• Is A’s primary location the destination?
• Number of Yellow-Page entities at destination (if any)
• Prior probability (based on log-normal ﬁt to A’s inter-query

times) of seeing any query by A before end of the day

(C) Context features (the ﬁrst seven features are present for each
of the three queries preceding the input address query)

• Search type of previous query
• Edit distance between previous and address query
• Jaccard distance between the previous and the address query
• Is previous query a substring of the Yellow-Page categories

of the businesses at the destination?

• Speed estimate based on the previous and the current location
• Is A currently conﬁrmed mobile? (Deﬁnition: previous query
is less than 10 min ago, the distance is at least 10 m, and the
average speed has been at least 4 km/h)

• Distance to destination reduced (absolute and relative) be-

tween the previous and the current queries

• Number of queries within the last {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64} min
• Number of address queries within the last {1, 2, 4, . . . } min

Results. We evaluate our method via 10-fold cross validation. To
avoid overﬁtting, we include all queries by the same user in the
same cross-validation fold. As the dataset is unbalanced, trivially
predicting a ‘no’ on every input would result in an accuracy of 93%.
To better assess the classiﬁer’s power, we create a balanced dataset
by subsampling negative examples randomly without replacement.
We assess prediction quality in terms of area under the ROC curve
(AUC). A random classiﬁcation achieves an AUC of 0.5.

We evaluate different combinations of the feature groups. The
most basic classiﬁer uses no information about the input query but
only characteristics of the user’s overall behavior (i.e., the U fea-
tures). Then, we incrementally add features from the two remain-
ing groups (Q and C). The observed boost in AUC provides in-
sights on the utility of the additional features. The resulting ROC
curves and AUC values are displayed in Fig. 5(b). We note that
user features alone perform signiﬁcantly better than random (AUC
0.821). Query and especially context features further improve per-
formance, resulting in a maximum AUC of 0.867 when using all
features. The steep initial increase of all ROC curves implies that
the top-ranked predictions are particularly reliable. Also, the corre-
sponding examples appear particularly obvious to predict, as even
the classiﬁer using only user features gets them right. The addi-
tional feature groups are most effective farther down in the rank-
ing, which follows from the ROC curves diverging more when true
positive rate (i.e., recall) is high. We also evaluated our classiﬁers
on the unbalanced dataset, obtaining similar ROC curves.

5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We described a study of search queries issued by people on the
move, focusing on queries about addresses. We are not the ﬁrst
to use geotagged log data; cf. [1] for a recent survey. Venetis et
al. [8] use historical address queries for ranking potential places of
interest in the vicinity of the user’s current location. However, our
characterizations and analysis of address queries are distinct from
prior research. For example, we assume a single place of interest
(the queried location) as given and try to predict whether the user
will transition to that place.

AUCs differ signiﬁcantly at p < 10−6 for all feature set pairs.

Short- and long-term patterns of human movement are investi-
gated by Sadilek and Krumm [6] and Cho et al. [3]. However, in
these efforts, future locations are predicted based only on the user’s
previous locations, independent of search queries. We anticipate
that combining our query-centric approach with ideas from these
works could further increase accuracy by leveraging information
present in historical long-term patterns of users’ movements.

Given the potential sensitivity of location data, applications need
to be aware of users’ privacy preferences and to seek their consent
for different uses of location. Beyond sharing location information
with service providers, privacy-sensitive applications can feasibly
provide such operations as location-sensitive ranking and ﬁltering
of results while limiting access of location data to local devices.

We see rich possibilities ahead for harnessing inferences about
users’ interests and forthcoming engagements with in-world re-
sources. Inferences about near- and longer-term Web-to-world tran-
sitions can be leveraged to provide a range of services in search
and advertising, including provision of information about direc-
tions and trafﬁc information, wait times, special offers, and tasks
that might be accomplished along the way.
