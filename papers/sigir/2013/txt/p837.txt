ABSTRACT
The textual context of an element, structurally, contains
traces of evidences. Utilizing this context in scoring is called
contextualization.
In this study we hypothesize that the
context of an XML-element originated from its preceding
and following elements in the sequential ordering of a doc-
ument improves the quality of retrieval. In the tree form of
the document’s structure, kinship contextualization means,
contextualization based on the horizontal and vertical ele-
ments in the kinship tree, or elements in closer to a wider
structural kinship. We have tested several variants of kin-
ship contextualization and veriﬁed notable improvements in
comparison with the baseline system and gold standards in
the retrieval of focused elements.

INTRODUCTION

Contextualization [3] is a mechanism which makes possible
the retrieval of items with varying length in textual content,
as the size of elements varies with the level in the hierar-
chy (see Figure 1); the leaf element or elements on low lev-
els of hierarchy have potentially less textual evidences than
their ancestors. The scant textual evidence in the small text
units, such as paragraphs, are augmented with information
obtainable from the context surrounding them.

The potential of contextualization has been revealed be-
fore in several intuitive settings [1–3, 5–8]. In the existing
studies, context of elements in focused retrieval has been
mainly referred to the ancestor elements. In addition to the
hierarchical order or the ancestor elements, documents also
have an established sequential ordering (paragraph 1 comes
prior to paragraph 2 and hence are siblings in the structural
tree (which we refer to as the kinship tree, see Figure 1),
in the documents hierarchical structure). In this study the

elements in the kinship tree, in the document’s sequential
order are considered to be the context - the kinship context.
The proposed models are experimentally validated using
the semantically annotated Wikipedia XML collection using
INEX [9] evaluation measures. The results obtained, on fo-
cused retrieval task (INEX), exhibit clear improvements over
the best submitted runs at INEX 2009, and over a strong
and competitive baseline system – itself based on data fusion
over all INEX 2009 submitted runs (Section 3).

Summarizing, the contributions of this study include:
• Contextualization utilizing the nodes in kinship rela-
in the hierarchical structure of
tionship (Figure 1),
documents, with random walks as a theoretically sound
foundation (Section 2.1).
• Developing a competitive focused retrieval system base-
line based on data fusion and constructing a test set-
ting for evaluating the retrieval of small textual units,
i.e., focused retrieval (Section 3).
• Experimental validation and evaluation (Section 4) of
the role of kinship contextualization on the large se-
mantically annotated Wikipedia XML corpora [9] (Sec-
tion 4).

2. CONTEXTUALIZATION

Contextualization is a re-scoring scheme, where the ba-
sic score, usually obtained from a full-text retrieval model,
of a contextualized document or element is re-enforced by
the weighted scores of the contextualizing documents or ele-
ments. We use random walks to induce a similarity structure
over the documents based on the containment and reverse-
containment relationships (element, sub-element and vice
versa). Hence, these relationships (kinships) aﬀect the weight
each contextualizing element has in contextualization.

The premise is that good context (identiﬁed by random
walk and contextualization model [6]) provides evidence that
an element in focused retrieval is a good candidate for a
posed query and therefore, the elements should be contex-
tualized by their hierarchically similar elements in “kinship”.
Good context is an evidence that should be used to deduce
that an element is a good candidate for the posed query.
2.1 Kinship Contextualization

In this section, we will show a formalism that can be
used to materialize and then utilize the contextual evidences
originated from the elements in the kinship tree,
in the
documents sequential order, for improving the retrieval ef-
fectiveness. Use of hierarchical information as a context
has been studied before in diﬀerent settings in XML re-
trieval [1, 3, 5, 8, 11]. In hierarchical contextualization the

intrinsic structure within the XML document is employed.
Kinship contextualization is both horizontal (siblings) and
vertical (ancestors & descendants elements) but intrinsically
non-hierarchical perspective of the hierarchical information.
The representation of documents in XML aims to follow the
established structure of documents, i.e., an academic book
is typically composed of (cid:104)chapters(cid:105), (cid:104)sections(cid:105), (cid:104)subsecs(cid:105),
(cid:104)paragraph(cid:105) and so on, structures. (cid:104)chapter1(cid:105) is followed by
(cid:104)chapter2(cid:105) and within (cid:104)chapter1(cid:105), (cid:104)section1(cid:105) is followed
by (cid:104)section2(cid:105). Elements (cid:104)section1(cid:105) and (cid:104)section2(cid:105) are
siblings, and hence most likely, semantically related. The
following element takes the concepts further from the pre-
ceding elements, and the preceding elements provide the ba-
sics or foundation for the following elements. Therefore,
together in the document order, the preceding and following
elements form a strong and connected perspective (the kin-
ship context), surrounding the relevant information. This
organization of document gives an intuitive starting point
for manipulating text passages at the established hierarchy
levels of text documents.

With contextualization from the preceding and following
elements, we aim to rank higher an element in a good context
(strong evidence in the kinship) than an identical element in
a not so good context (less or no evidence in the kinship tree)
within the document. In Figure 1 the (cid:104)entry(cid:105) element has
the preceding (cid:104)entry(cid:105) and following (cid:104)entry(cid:105) as the kinship
context. Hence one element can be viewed in context of its
kinships, the elements preceding and following it.

In kinship contextualization, like the other types of con-
textualization [3, 6], the weight of the element is modiﬁed
by the basic weights of its contextualizing elements. Each
element in the context of the contextualized element, should
possess an impact factor. An higher impact factor shows the
importance of the contextualizing element and vice versa.
The role and relation of contextualizing element are oper-
ationalized by giving the element a contextualizing weight.
A contextualization vector is deﬁned to capture the impact
factor of each contextualizing element, and this contextual-
ization vector is represented by a g function in Equation 1.
The important research question here is: how far wide
(siblings) and how deep (direct parent or siblings at ances-
tral level), the element’s kinship context help to improve
retrieval eﬀectiveness? Arvola et al.
(2011) [3], in their
horizontal contextualization approach, used a weight array,
which follows a zero centred parabola function – the impact
of contextualization is adjusted with a help of diﬀerent set
of parameters. The weight of contextualizing element is as-
sumed to be the function of distance, hence the weight ought

to be lower the further away the contextualizing element is
from the contextualized element. Instead of employing the
weight function, to ﬁnd the impact of each of the units in
the context, we propose here, a generalized mechanism based
on the Markovian random walk principle [6] and the kinship
contextualization.
2.1.1 Random Walk
The tree-structure of the XML document (Figure 1) is
considered as a graph. Myriad of random surfers traverse
the XML graphs. In particular, at any time step a random
surfer is found at an element and either (a) makes a next
move to the sub-element of the existing element by travers-
ing the containment edge, or (b) makes a move to the parent-
element of the existing element, or (c) jumps randomly to
another element in the XML graph. As the time goes on,
the expected percentage of surfer at each node converges to a
limit the dominant eigenvector of the XML graph. This limit
provides the impact or strength of each element in the con-
text of the contextualized element in the form of g function.
In kinship contextualization, we consider all the elements in
the kinship of the contextualized element; where the contex-
tualization vector g in this case, identiﬁes the importance of
each of the unit of context in kinship(Equation 1).

Contextualization model formulated in this way, is inde-
pendent of the basic weighting scheme of the elements and
it could be applied on the top of any query language and
retrieval systems. We have applied the contextualization
model on the top of the baseline system which is the result
of fusion from the INEX 2009 oﬃcially submitted runs by
the participants (see Section 3).

In the experiments we evaluated the retrieval eﬀectiveness
at diﬀerent granularity levels. We mainly tested, retrieval
eﬀectiveness based on the element selection in focused re-
trieval task (using the INEX evaluation kit); a brief intuition
is explained in Section 3.
2.1.2 Kinship Contextualization at different level
We have experimented with kinship contextualization at
diﬀerent levels of hierarchy. Kinship contextualization with
elements in kinship from:
• direct parent, CRp
• grand parent, CRgp
• grand grand parent, CRggp
• root, the (cid:104)article(cid:105) element, CRa

The re-ranking function based on the random walk prin-

ciple, described earlier, can be formally deﬁned as follows:

(cid:88)

(cid:88)

y∈Cx

CR(x, f, Cx, gk) = BS(x) + f ·

y∈Cx

BS(y) · gk(y)

(1)

gk(y)

(text-based score, e.g., tf · ief )

where• BS(x) is the basic score of contextualized element x
• f is a parameter which determines the weight of the
context in the overall scoring.
• Cx is the kinship context surrounding the contextualiz-
ing element x, i.e., Cx ⊆ kinships(x), ⊆, because only
the context containing the query terms are considered.
• gk(y) is the generalized contextualization vector based
on random walk, which gives the authority weight (the
impact) of y, the contextualizing elements (kinships)
of x in XML graph. Similar interpretation is used in
our earlier studies [6]

3. TEST SETTINGS & FUSION BASELINE
We test our approach using the Wikipedia collection con-
taining 2.66 million semantically annotated XML documents
(50, 7 Gb) and 68 related topics provided by the INEX 2009
ad-hoc track [4]. The reason for using the INEX 2009 test
topics (instead of 2010) is the larger variety of elements in
the participants’ results which was due to the existence of
the thorough task. In order to get the best possible base-
line, we performed a data fusion based on sum of normalized
scores (CombSUM) [10]. The element scores (for each run
per topic) were normalized for the fusion as follows:

scorex =

scorex − min(scores)

max(scores) − min(scores)

(2)

where max(scores) and min(scores) denote the maximal

and minimal scores respectively.

We used all the 98 INEX 2009 runs delivering correct el-
ement result lists as component systems for the fusion. The
2009 runs have the largest variety in the results for the fu-
sion in comparison to other years of the initiative. Unfortu-
nately, most of the participants (56) did not report any real
element scores, because the INEX evaluation did not require
that information. For those systems an artiﬁcial score was
given for each element based on their reciprocal rank, before
the normalization. In other words, the ﬁrst element in the
result list was given a score 1, the second 1/2, third 1/3,
fourth 1/4 and so on.

The focused task in INEX ad-hoc track is to retrieve
most focused elements satisfying an information need with-
out overlapping elements. An overlapping result list means
that the elements in the result list may have a descendant re-
lationship with each other and share the same text content.
For instance, in Figure 1 the entry element (cid:104)1.2.2.2.1(cid:105) and
the (cid:104)sec(cid:105) element (cid:104)1.2.2(cid:105) are overlapping. In this study we
are following the focused approach, considering a result list
where only one of the overlapping elements from each branch
is selected. This means that including the (cid:104)sec(cid:105) element in
the results would mean excluding the entry element in the
results or vice versa.

The fused result list contains all the elements delivered by
the 98 component systems. This comprehensive result list

contains overlapping elements. In order to remove the over-
lap, we basically selected elements having the highest score
from each branch. However, many participants returned
runs having full-articles only, which led to full-article bias in
the fusion results. Therefore, we made a deliberate choice to
exclude full-articles in the results, following a more focused
retrieval strategy. The result lists were measured using the
oﬃcial INEX evaluation metrics and software for the focused
task [4].

Contextualization and the fusion approach as scoring meth-
ods, however, do not take any stand on which elements
should be selected from each branch. Thus we perform a
structural fusion, where we take the element level selection
from the baseline run and subsequently re-rank the elements
of the baseline run. For instance (in Figure 1) if the baseline
run suggests the (cid:104)body(cid:105) element, we select that one, not the
(cid:104)list(cid:105) element beneath, regardless of their mutual ranking
in the full list.
4. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION

The hierarchical structure of XML documents are cap-
tured using the dewey encoding scheme (as shown in the
Figure 1). This way each element in the document possess a
unique index within the document, and together with docu-
ment’s unique id, this becomes unique for the entire collec-
tion. The tree structure of XML documents are converted
into a matrix, and random walk is performed on this matrix,
as it is described in detail, in our earlier work [6]. The con-
textualization vector gk from Equation 1 is computed oﬀ-line
for each and every XML document in the Wikipedia collec-
tion. This suggests that computing gk vector is feasible for
a reasonably large XML document collections. At the query
time, the scores from gk vector and the basic scores are com-
bined to produce an overall ranking score, using Equation 1.
We have experimented with all the four variants of kinship
contextualization (Section 2.1) and compared them against
the diﬀerent baseline systems, (Table 1, sorted on interpolated
precision at recall 0.01, iP [0.01]). The runs in Table 1 are
among the best runs submitted at INEX 2009 ad-hoc track,
focused retrieval task.

In the combination function given, the contextualization
force has to be parametrized. For the proposed contextu-
alization model, we tuned the contextualization force and
report the values leading to best overall performance.
In
our parametrization process we found the optimal values of
contextualization force f (from Equation 1) lies in the range:
(f ∈ {3.25, 3.50, 3.75, 4.00, 4.25, 4.50}). These optimal val-
ues for f are obtained by using cross-validation technique.
We did 68-fold cross-validation (or complete cross-validation
in our case) - by randomly partitioning the collection into 68

839training and test samples based on the number of assessed
topics. Of the 68 samples, a single sample is retained as the
validation set for testing, and remaining 67 samples are used
as training set. The cross-validation process is repeated 68
times (for each fold), with each of 68 samples used exactly
only once as validation set. These 68 independent or unseen
samples are then combined to produce a single or a set of
estimations for parameter f .

The best overall results among the proposed methods are
obtained with CRggp
kinship, in terms of best
iP [0.01] values (early precision). The kinship context from
the hierarchical structure of documents, employed in contex-
tualization, indeed improves the retrieval eﬀectiveness, and
the improvements are in-line with theoretical anticipations.
5. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

Contextualization is a re-ranking model, utilizing the con-
text of the relevant retrievable unit, for improving the overall
retrieval. We have presented an exploratory study into the
use of context from elements in kinship in the hierarchical
structure of information, to improve retrieval performance
on focused retrieval tasks. We looked at context from doc-
ument’s sequential ordering, which we call the kinship con-
text. Hence, we hypothesized that context gathered from

the kinships, “horizontally” and “vertically” from the graph
structure of document, inﬂuences the retrieval eﬀectiveness.
Experiments have validated the hypothesis that utilizing the
kinship context this way actually enhances the retrieval of
information in focused retrieval task. The results obtained
are in-line with the earlier work on contextualization [1, 3, 5–
8]. However, none of the existing works consider the kinship
context, as a source of contextual evidence.

The approaches presented are generic and can be applied
to diﬀerent test collections and baseline systems. Evidence
are collected in a systematic way, from the surroundings,
the kinship context of the element to be ranked. XML doc-
uments are used as a sample case of semi-structured docu-
ments, these documents have hierarchical structure, which is
often represented in a form of tree. However, the approaches
could also be applicable for other generic structured (or
semi-structured) test collections (e.g., Linked Data, RDF,
etc.), where the structure may be represented as a general
graph (with cycles). The proposed methods are particularly
suited for collections that carry more types of evidence than
just textual information.
