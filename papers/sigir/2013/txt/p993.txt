ABSTRACT 
Mobile  devices  provide  people  with  a  conduit  to  the  rich  infor-
mation  resources  of  the  Web.  With  consent,  the  devices  can  also 
provide streams of information about search activity and location 
that can be used in population studies and real-time assistance. We 
analyzed geotagged mobile queries in a privacy-sensitive study of 
potential  transitions  from  health  information  search  to  in-world 
healthcare utilization. We note differences in people’s health infor-
mation seeking before, during, and after the appearance of evidence 
that a medical facility has been visited. We find that we can accu-
rately estimate statistics about such potential user engagement with 
healthcare providers. The findings highlight the promise of using 
geocoded search for sensing and predicting activities in the world.

1.  INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 
Mobile devices allow people to search the Web as they travel and 
engage in the physical world. The devices can serve as large-scale 
sensor  networks  for  population-wide  studies  of  behavior  and  the 
environment. Mobile devices that sense location have the ability to 
provide information on connections between online activities and 
activities  in  physical  world.  In  recent  work,  researchers  demon-
strated how a log of geocoded mobile queries could be harnessed 
in a privacy-sensitive manner to make inferences about how health 
search evolves into transitions in location that appear to represent 
healthcare utilization (HU) [9]. Other sources such as queries [2], 
blogs [5], and social media [6] have been used as spatiotemporal 
sensors, but  none  offer  the  clear  relationship between  virtual  and 
physical spaces as do geocoded mobile queries. We show how such 
logs  can  be  applied  to  extend  prior  studies  and  can  provide  new 
insights about healthcare utilization from mobile logs. 

Given estimates of HU events derived from mobile queries issued 
to a Web search engine, we identify and monitor the following: 
Search intent dynamics: Previous research has examined patterns 
of behavior with people’s health information seeking over time [8].

We show that mobile query logs can provide insights on search in-
terests and concerns before patients arrive at a healthcare facility, 
as they wait or receive treatment, and after they depart. 
Population-level utilization analyses: Public organizations such as 
the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC)  compute 
statistics on healthcare utilization. We explore the possibility of us-
ing mobile query logs to complement traditional tracking and mon-
itoring as a low cost means of estimating the statistics of HU.  
Patient-specific  predictions:  We  show  that  signals  from  mobile 
search logs can predict the duration of a forthcoming stay at medi-
cal facilities, enabling such applications as patient triage.  

We first describe the procedure by which we estimate HU events 
from geocoded mobile query logs. We then present several differ-
ent uses of these inferred visits. We characterize behavior before, 
during,  and  after  an  inferred  visit,  estimating  visit  statistics,  and 
predicting the duration of a user’s stay at a medical facility.  

2.  HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION & LOGS  
A key premise of our study is that we can identify when users are 
likely visiting healthcare facilities and/or engaging with healthcare 
professionals.  We  begin  by  describing the datasets  we  use  in  our 
study and the methods we used to infer utilization. 
2.1  Data 
We collected datasets with consent via a widely available applica-
tion provided by a major mobile search provider. The application 
runs on the Android and iPhone platforms. Users agreed to share 
their search activities and location information per a published pri-
vacy  statement,  which  grants  uses  of  the  data  to  the  provider  for 
internal  analysis  and  service  improvement.  We  used  automated 
tools to process the data in the aggregate. In this process, all data 
were stripped of individually identifiable information. Direct loca-
tion information was removed and not used in the analysis.   

We used a dataset spanning one year of activity from approximately 
30K users who had agreed to share their search activities and loca-
tion  information.  The  log  consists  of  several  hundred  thousand 
search entries stored on a secure server. Each entry corresponds to 
a search interaction with a mobile application issued by an anony-
mized  user,  represented  by  a  unique  numerical  identifier.  Entries 
contain  the  search  query,  the  time,  and  GPS  location  when  the 
query  was  submitted.  Location  information  was  recorded  only  if 
and when a search query was issued. The absolute locations of users 
were removed. As in [9], only the distance between the user and 
the location of medical facilities was stored. To compute the dis-
tances, we obtained the GPS coordinates of medical facilities across 
the  United  States  through  a  crawl  of  business  listings,  which  in-
cludes  data  from  a  variety  of  sources  such  as  the  Yellow  Pages 
(yp.com). The database of facilities contains 34,750 medical facil-
ity  sites.  Site  types  include  emergency  medical  and  surgical  ser-
vices (54.7%), hospitals (34.1%), medical centers (10.5%), and out-
patient  services  (0.6%).  As  we  sought  to  understand  long-term 
search patterns, we removed users with < 90 days of search history.  

9932.2  Evidence of Healthcare Utilization 
To identify searchers  who may be utilizing medical facilities,  we 
consider the spatial context in which a medical query was issued. 
We only consider whether people searched for medical information 
from within a certain distance (200 meters in our case) from a med-
ical facility, following methods used and evaluated in [9]. In par-
ticular, we consider non-periodic proximity to a medical facility as 
salient evidence of healthcare utilization (EHU). We further char-
acterize  engagements  with  healthcare  facilities  with  information 
about  whether  the  GPS  signal  was  available;  GPS  is  generally 
available  outside  but  is often  lost  when  indoors.  We  assume  that 
searches may occur within a healthcare facility when a GPS signal 
is not attainable for a period of time (e.g., from 30 minutes to a few 
days)  following  observation  of  EHU.  Types  of  engagements  at  a 
medical facility include seeking treatment, visiting an admitted pa-
tient, and accompanying a patient. For simplicity we shall refer to 
all of these activities as healthcare utilization. In our data set, 5239 
users (14.8% of the total number) queried from within 200 meters 
of  the  medical  facility  at  least  once,  providing  evidence  of  HU. 
Note that although the proximal query provides a useful way of es-
timating HU, this mechanism may introduce population bias (e.g., 
these users may be younger or more technologically savvy).  
2.3  Error Reduction 
We seek to make inferences about HU from the log, which serves 
as a noisy and sparse sensor; we cannot completely resolve uncer-
tainty about whether the EHUs as defined actually represent a visit 
or a true engagement. Given the nature of the logs, we were unable 
to distinguish between users visiting the medical facility for treat-
ment, to visit or escort an admitted patient, or simply working at or 
traveling near the facility but not using its health-related services. 
To reduce the likelihood of errors, we require that users had previ-
ously searched for at least one of a set of tracked symptoms or syn-
onyms from the Merck medical dictionary in the 90 days before the 
EHU visit, demonstrating a health interest or concern. In total, 4006 
of  the  5239  users  (76.5%)  met  this  requirement.  To  improve  the 
likelihood that observed EHU events were related to treatment and 
consultation, we removed the 885 users (22.1%) who had queried 
from within 200 meters of the facility in the time period before the 
first symptom query and who had queried frequently near a facility 
(where  more  than  30 of  the 90  days  of  search  activities  occurred 
within 200m of a facility). These users may live near the facility, 
may work at or near the facility or be receiving long-term care at 
the facility, and would hence not be relevant to our focus on transi-
tions from Web search to in-world healthcare utilization. 

3.  ANALYZING UTILIZATION 
Given an estimate for HU from mobile search logs, we analyze as-
pects of this activity, specifically studying the dynamics of search 
intent surrounding the EHU visit. We now characterize intentions 
and seek to predict the duration for each inferred visit. 

3.1  Search Intent Dynamics 
We  first  explore  the  dynamics  of  health-related  search  goals  that 
may  be  attributed  to  inferred  HU.  Specifically,  as  a  user’s  health 
condition evolves (e.g., from normal, to ill (or concerned about an 
illness), to recovered), or engagement status changes (e.g., from ap-
proaching a facility, to engaging with a healthcare practitioner, to 
departing a facility), how is their search behavior affected? We tar-
get the presence of the following health signals in mobile queries: 

•  Symptoms. Symptom queries can capture the onset of medical 
concerns. We label a query as symptom-related if it contains at 
least  one  symptom  term  (e.g.,  “twitching”,  “headache”).  The 
list  of  possible  symptoms  is  extracted  from  the  online  Merck

medical dictionary. To improve coverage, we also include the 
synonyms of each symptom, which are identified via a two-step 
random walk on the click-graph of a search engine [3].  

•  Body-part names. We use a list of major appendages and or-
gans as body-part names obtained from reviews of web sites on 
human anatomy [4], and track them in queries. Body parts can 
be related to symptoms (e.g., chest pain), treatments (e.g., kid-
ney transplant), or outcomes (e.g., back pain after surgery). 

•  Benign and serious conditions. We also look for the presence 
of  benign  or  serious  medical  conditions in  queries,  which  are 
extracted based on the list of conditions in [4] and their syno-
nyms.  Condition-related  queries  can  indicate  hypothesis-di-
rected search such as pursuing a diagnosis given symptoms or 
seeking additional information about certain conditions. 

•  Healthcare  utilization intentions (HUI). We  also track que-
ries  that  demonstrate  pursuit  of  in-world  healthcare,  such  as 
searches for a clinic or hospital.  Such HUI searches may arise 
as information seeking about symptoms or diagnostic hypothe-
ses escalates to the pursuit of in-world resources [7].  

•  Drugs.  We  define  a  set  of  common  medications  and  monitor 
the presence of them in search queries. Medications are directly 
related to treatment and remedy of symptoms and disorders. 

Queries are classified into one of these categories via a white-list- 
based string-match classifier. When a query has overlap with mul-
tiple categories, we assign it to the category with highest overlap. 

For each searcher demonstrating EHU, we divide search sequences 
into three phases, i.e., before, during (i.e., user queries near a med-
ical facility and the GPS signal is unavailable or “dark,” suggesting 
that they are indoors), and after the assumed HU. We track the dy-
namics of the searcher’s intent by computing the fraction of their 
search queries on the aforementioned five categories in each phase. 
The average dynamics over all users with EHU are depicted in Fig-
ure 1. The figure shows the fraction of all observed queries that fall 
into  each  phase  before,  during,  and  after  the  visit.  For  example, 
0.1% of queries observed before and after the EHU contain symp-
toms, but 0.18% of the queries during the visit are associated with 
symptoms. There are a number of noteworthy patterns in the termi-
nological shifts between the three phases: 
1. More searching symptoms and human anatomy when users are 
close to a medical facility (within 200m and GPS dark) than far 
away from it, suggesting that searchers have stronger interest 
and concerns about health when searching near a hospital. 

2. There is a stronger interest in HUIs prior to the visit to the facility 
and this diminishes dramatically once the user reaches the facil-
ity (dropping to nearly half the pre-visit level). Since the EHU is

based on the GPS location and not the query content, this transi-
tion provides strong evidence of HU. 

3. We observe changes in the mix of health-related search goals as 
people transition to different phases of engagement. In particular, 
users were observed searching significantly more often for con-
ditions  (doubled)  before  the  assumed  engagement  than  in  the 
other  phases,  anatomical  names  (tripled)  and  symptoms  (dou-
bled)  during  engagement  than  other  phases,  and  drug  names 
(seven times higher) following the visit. 

4. We believe that the transition from conditions and HUI (before 
engagement), to symptoms and body-parts (during engagement), 
and eventually to treatments and drug names (after engagement) 
reflects shifts in information needs over the course of healthcare 
engagement  episodes.  The  mobile  query  logs  appear  to  reflect 
patients moving from concerns and questions about their condi-
tions,  to  those  of  diagnosis  and  symptoms,  and  eventually  to 
treatments and post-visit recovery. 

Although these findings may be unsurprising, they show that sens-
ing is to some extent reliable and highlight the potential value of 
geocoded query analysis for linking online intent with in-world use. 

We also examined how healthcare engagement influences search-
ers’  medical  concerns.  As  an  example,  we  sought  to  understand 
how evidence of engagement with a healthcare professional might 
lead  to  signs  of  resolution  of  concerns.  One  way  to  do  this  is  by 
examining if and how the frequency of question words (i.e., what, 
which, when, why, how, and who) in medical queries changes with 
the  phase  of  the  engagement.  One  might  expect  to  see  that  users 
have  more  uncertainty  and  questions  before,  and  perhaps  during, 
the early portion of healthcare engagement than after it. We did not 
observe significant changes in the use of question words in mobile 
medical queries over the course of the engagement. One explana-
tion  is  that  while  the  engagement  may  address  some  concerns,  it 
also raises others. We observed that queries issued during engage-
ment were on average more technical than in other scenarios, sug-
gesting  that  users  may  adopt  terminology  from  discussions  with 
healthcare  professionals,  or  seek  the  meaning  of  specialist  terms 
encountered. We shall investigate query technicality in more detail. 

3.2  Estimating Visit Durations 
We now consider estimations of durations of engagements at med-
ical facilities. The primary focus in this analysis is in comparing the 
statistics obtained from the mobile search log to ground truth pro-
vided by the CDC. The CDC statistics are based on outpatient rec-
ords, collected from a range of medical facilities across the US.  

Since we only have access to location information when users enter 
queries, we are uncertain about exact time a user enters or leaves a 
facility.  Figure 2 shows an example of a visit to a medical facility, 
defined in the figure as time period where the user’s GPS signal is 
dark  (i.e.,  they  are  likely  indoors).  Assume  the  last  query  before 
engagement that the searcher issued when the GPS signal is avail-
able (light) was at time t1, the first query  when their GPS is una-
vailable (dark) was at time t2, the last query issued at dark was at 
time t3 and the first query after engagement issued when their GPS

device first received a signal was at t4.  Our estimate of start time ts 
= (t1 + t2)/2, estimated end time te = (t3 + t4)/2, and estimated dura-
tion ∆t = te – ts. The measurement error e = (t2-t1)/2 + (t4-t3)/2. The 
relative measurement error E = e/∆t. To mitigate the measurement 
error,  we  perform  explicit  filtering  by  removing  all  EHU  events 
whose relative measurement errors exceed 20%. 

The duration estimates that we obtain from our mobile search log 
analysis are provided in Table 1. Since the time that people spend 
at a facility is influenced by the type of facility (e.g., people may 
tend to spend more time in inpatient facilities than outpatient cen-
ters), we split our analysis into urgent care facilities and hospitals. 
For reference purposes, the CDC statistics on durations at each of 
the two facility types are also provided [1]. We can clearly see from 
Table 1 that estimates of durations of engagement times from the 
mobile search logs resonate well with the CDC statistics. 

3.3  Forecasting Visit Durations 
Given the accuracy with which we were able to estimate durations, 
we explored the use of predictive models to estimate the duration 
of an upcoming healthcare engagement based on a searcher’s pre-
engagement  search  behavior.  These  predictive  models  might  be 
used one day for assistance in clinically-relevant forecasting tasks, 
such as helping medical facilities triage patients before their arrival. 
The features we used in our predictions are listed in Table 2. We 
breakout EHU into any EHU (query proximal to a medical facility) 
and indoor EHU (query proximal to medical facility and GPS sig-
nal  has  gone  dark,  suggesting  that  they  are  inside  the  facility  at 
query time). Note that prior utilization or engagement features are 
computed using search activity > 12 hours before each engagement 
to reduce the likelihood of overlap with the engagement itself.

Figure 4. Prediction errors with linear regression and  
generalized linear model regression (± standard error).  

One important feature that we mentioned earlier is query technical-
ity,  which  captures  the  sophistication  of  the  medical  terminology 
used by a searcher. We implemented a query technicality estimator 
based on a statistical language  model similar to the approach de-
scribed  in [10].  The  technicality  model  was  learned  from  a  large 
corpus  comprising  medical  documents  from  domains  of  different 
technicality  (e.g.,  PubMed,  MeSH,  CDC,  WebMD,  and  medical 
search  queries  issued  on  Bing.com).  Technicality  estimations  for 
queries are not accepted if the confidence is low. The technicality 
estimator enables us to track the specificity of a searcher’s medical 
concerns  over  the  course  of  HU.  Figure  3  plots  the  temporal  dy-
namics of a searcher’s query technicality during an engagement. As 
a reference, the normal level of query technicality for each user (in-
dependent of the visit) is also given as “all” in Figure 3. We can see 
the visit to the facility influences query technicality, suggesting that 
there may be exposure to technical terminology at the facility that 
emerges in query streams. Technicality also trends slightly down-
ward over time, suggesting that most of the effect on query behav-
ior occurs within a short time of the visit beginning. One explana-
tion is diagnoses may be rendered soon after arrival of the patient. 

A key challenge in our prediction is a lack of supervised data. We 
do not have access to the ground truth (e.g., the exact duration) of 
the potential engagements. For example, assuming a healthcare en-
gagement  for  which  the  log-based  estimation  of  duration  is  four 
hours  with  a  measurement  error  of  three  hours,  the  true  duration 
could be any value between one and seven hours. We know that we 
are grappling with substantial and unavoidable measurement errors.  
We  cannot  overcome  the  errors  with  our  methodology.  To  make 
our prediction tractable, we removed engagement sessions with ex-
cessive measurement errors. Particularly, we require that for each 
engagement, the start distance and end distance, i.e., the distances 
at  which  the  searcher  issued  a  query  when  the  engagement 
started/ended, are at most 150m and one mile respectively from the 
facility. This restriction results in 179 EHU sessions, with an aver-
age measurement error (defined in previous section) of 83.86%. 

The  duration prediction task  can  be  formulated  naturally  as  a  re-
gression  problem,  i.e.,  given  the  features  extracted  from  the  pre-
engagement search activities, we seek to predict the duration of an 
engagement.  We  experimented  with  two  regression  models  with

the 25 features (Table 2). We used a linear regression model with 
L2 regularization and a generalized linear model (GLM) with a re-
ciprocal link function (i.e., assuming that the duration follows an 
exponential distribution rather than normal) and L2 regularization. 
The models were trained and tested based on a leave-one-out cross-
validation, where the relative error compared to the estimated du-
ration was used as the evaluation metric. The prediction results are 
reported in Figure 4. Promisingly, they show that the GLM attains 
a prediction accuracy close to the measurement error. To better un-
derstand the engagement duration, Table 3 lists the top 10 most im-
portant features and their weights (normalized against the most im-
portant feature). The analysis shows that query technicality and pre-
vious EHUs are the strongest predictors, but other features such as 
facility type and general medical searching are also important. 
4.  CONCLUSIONS 
Using geotagged mobile searches as sensors for healthcare utiliza-
tion, we explore health seeking behavior and seek to identify en-
gagements with professional health providers. We also use search 
activity to estimate durations of healthcare utilization for different 
facility  types  and  find  strong  agreement  with  CDC  statistics.  We 
use mobile search logs to predict engagement durations, consider-
ing medical search histories and prior engagement information. We 
are enthusiastic about the promise of the methods described in this 
paper, and envision privacy-sensitive applications that could pro-
vide value in the healthcare domain and beyond.
