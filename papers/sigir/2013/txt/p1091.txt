ABSTRACT
We propose and implement a robust text detection system,
which is a prominent step-in for text retrieval in natural
scene images or videos. Our system includes several key
components: (1) A fast and eﬀective pruning algorithm is
designed to extract Maximally Stable Extremal Regions as
character candidates using the strategy of minimizing reg-
ularized variations. (2) Character candidates are grouped
into text candidates by the single-link clustering algorithm,
where distance weights and threshold of clustering are learned
automatically by a novel self-training distance metric learn-
ing algorithm. (3) The posterior probabilities of text candi-
dates corresponding to non-text are estimated with an char-
acter classiﬁer; text candidates with high probabilities are
then eliminated and ﬁnally texts are identiﬁed with a text
classiﬁer. The proposed system is evaluated on the ICDAR
2011 Robust Reading Competition dataset and a publicly
available multilingual dataset; the f measures are over 76%
and 74% which are signiﬁcantly better than the state-of-the-
art performances of 71% and 65%, respectively.

INTRODUCTION

Text in images contains valuable information and is ex-
ploited in many content-based image and video applications,
such as content-based web image search, video information
retrieval, mobile based text analysis and recognition, espe-
cially for text retrieval in natural scene images. Due to com-
plex background, variations of font, size, color and orienta-
tion, text in natural scene images has to be robustly detected
before being recognized or retrieved.

Recently, Maximally Stable Extremal Region (MSER) based

text detection methods, which actually fall into the family
of connected component based methods but use MSERs [1]
as character candidates, have become the focus of several
recent projects [5, 3, 2, 6].

Although the MSER based method is the winning method
of the benchmark data, i.e., ICDAR 2011 Robust Reading
Competition [5] and has reported promising performance,
there remains several problems to be addressed. First, as the
MSER algorithm detects a large number of non-characters,
on one hand, it may still have room for further improve-
ment in terms of the accuracies; on the other hand, it tends
to be slow because of the computation of complex features.
Second, current approaches [3, 4] for text candidates con-
struction is time consuming and error pruning.

We propose a robust and accurate MSER based scene text
detection method. First, we designed a fast and accurate
MSERs pruning algorithm; the number of character candi-
dates to be processed is signiﬁcantly reduced with a high
accuracy. Second, we propose a novel self-training distance
metric learning algorithm that can learn distance weights
and clustering threshold simultaneously and automatically;
character candidates are clustered into text candidates by
the single-link clustering algorithm using the learned pa-
rameters. Third, we propose to use a character classiﬁer to
estimate the posterior probabilities of text candidates corre-
sponding to non-text and remove text candidates with high
probabilities. By integrating the above ideas, we built an
accurate and robust scene text detection system.

2. SYSTEM OVERVIEW

The structure of our novel MSER based text detection
system, as well as the sample result of each stage is presented
in Figure 1, which includes the following stages:

1091Second, experiments on a multilingual dataset [4] are also
conducted. The training dataset contains 248 images and
the testing dateset contains 239 images.

tion algorithms on the multilingual dataset.

The performance of our system (include Scheme-I and
Scheme-II) and Pan et al.’s method [4] is presented in Ta-
ble 2. The main diﬀerence between Scheme-I and Scheme-
II is that the character classiﬁer in the ﬁrst scheme is trained
on the ICDAR 2011 training set while the character clas-
siﬁer in the second scheme is trained on the multilingual
training set. The result comparison between Scheme-I and
Scheme-II in Table 2 shows that the performance of the
proposed system is signiﬁcantly improved because of the in-
corporating of the Chinese-friendly character classiﬁer.

Finally, we have setup an online demo of our proposed sys-
tem at “http://kems.ustb.edu.cn/learning/yin/dtext”.
We also develop an application software of camera-based re-
altime scene text detection in Android Phones and Tablets.

Figure 1: Flowchart of the proposed system.

1) Character candidates extraction. character candidates
are extracted with MSERs; most of the non-characters are
reduced by the proposed MSERs pruning algorithm using
the strategy of minimizing regularized variations.

2) Text candidates construction. distance weights and
threshold are learned simultaneously using a novel metric
learning algorithm; character candidates are clustered into
text candidates by the single-link clustering algorithm using
the learned parameters.

3) Text candidates elimination. the posterior probabilities
of text candidates corresponding to non-text are measured
using the character classiﬁer and text candidates with high
probabilities for non-text are removed.

4) Text candidates classiﬁcation. text candidates corre-
sponding to true text are identiﬁed by the text classiﬁer.
An AdaBoost classiﬁer is trained to decide whether an text
candidate corresponding to true text or not.

For more details we refer the reader to [7, 8].

3. EXPERIMENTS AND DEMOS

First, we perform experiments on ICDAR 2011 Compe-
tition dataset. The performance of our system, together
with Neumann and Matas’ method [3], a very recent MSER
based method by Shi et al. [6] and the top 3 scoring methods
(Kim’s, Yi’s and TH-TextLoc) from ICDAR 2011 Competi-
tion are presented in Table 1. As can be seen from Table 1,
our method produces much better recall, precision and f
measure over other methods on this dataset. The average
processing speed of the proposed system on a general Linux
laptop is 0.43s per image.

tion algorithms on ICDAR 2011 data.
